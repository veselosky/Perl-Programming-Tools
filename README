Perl Programming Tools

This distribution is a set of modules and scripts that I maintain for my own
web development and scripting. It's mostly a "scratch" area where I play with
things. It is in no way stable and not guaranteed to be usable (even for me).
If you find it useful, great! If not, well, write your own code, sucka!
